Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

A few days ago, I saw a beautiful abstract picture of a bird on the website which is really interesting. I decided to imitate the picture and try to draw it with D3.js immediately. As we can see, for the head of the bird, I overlaid several circles and arcs with different colors which makes it look like a head. I also draw a triangle which I look as the beak.

Then, as the body part of bird, itâ€™s more irregular than the head. Thus, I used polygons to achieve the goal. The body of the bird is made up of four polygons and I use the same color system to make the bird beautiful. And the claw is also a black triangle.

At last, I drew a gray rectangle and a few black lines to create a ground where the bird stands.
