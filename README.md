This assinment was completed to simulate an image from my favorite book series. The illustration represents the different factions in the series The Stormlight Archive, by Brandon Sanderson. Here is the image I derived my project from.

My final submission is a simplified version of this, but it allowed me to become familiar with d3 shape attributes. I used the line, rectangle, circle, and polygon shapes together to construct this image. It was helpful to learn how to organize shapes on a screen with d3 and fit objects within an svg. It was also important to learn how layering works for d3.

Ideally I would have been able to implement a way to display the name of each faction when the mouse hovered over, but I was unable to implement it for more than a single circle. I attempted to use a tooltip, but it only allowed for a single name to be displayed, no matter what circle was highlighted.
