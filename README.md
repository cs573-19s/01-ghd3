Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

Description:-
---
X and O is a simple, fun and popular game, and my original intention was to simulate an instance of this game. But unfortunately, since I am new to d3, my understanding of using transitions and other dynamic components was inaccurate, and hence I was not able to use them as I had intended to. In the end, I had to content myself with just showing the final result and snapshot of the game, which is shown below: -
