Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

Overview
---
In order to get started with learning how to create basic shapes in D3 I used the following LinkedIn Learning course as a guide: 
"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/d3-js-essential-training-for-data-scientists/introduction". I coded along with the course so elements of my code resemble the code that was shared during the course. Additionally, the course gave a refresher on HTML and a lesson on JavaScript as well as helped me gain a better understanding of SVG objects. 

Design Achievement Description 
---
My index.html is hosted at the following link: "https://longenbach.github.io/01-ghd3/index.html". 

Below our a few SVG objects I have decided to feature. I created some rectangles with circles centered above them. As you mouse over a blue shape it turns to red and vice versa. I made some lines that enlarge when the mouse is dragged over. Additionally, I spent some time learning how to create an SVG path and made a normal distribution where two standard deviations above the mean is heighted purple when the mouse is dragged over. If I had more time I would have liked to add a feature that assigns a random color to a shape when touched by the mouse.

Technical Achievement Description   
---
My index.html is more of a shape playground at this point. Being new to JavaScript I put more emphasis on learning the syntax and understanding by tweaking the parameters than trying to create a final product. I do feel I now have a better handle of basic shapes, generators, and paths in D3. However, going forward I hope to gain a better understanding of how to best arrange SVG objects and start learning how to build graphs/axes.
