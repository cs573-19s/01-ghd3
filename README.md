Description
---

This webpage is designed for the user to have a little fun with this basic assignment. The webpage is called Shape Arcade becuase there are 3 little minigames that the user can play. The first invoves polygons where the user must click the different shapes until they form a basic pentagon. The second game with the circles is connect the dots. The user can connect each circle to form the larger circle (or they can have some fun and create their own design using the circle and connecting whatever dot they want). Finally the squares are just a basic visual where the squares will travel the distance of the lines and change color when they are moused over. 

Technical Achievements

- Made the polygons change shape when they are clicked on
- Made Circles interactive by creating a line between two points when clicked on
- Change the shape and color of a shape after an event
- Translate an object using transitions


Design Achievements
---

- Instead of just shapes on the webpage, made basic minigames for the user to play around with
- Configured webpage to use bootstrap to help organize the 3 SVGs
- Given an array of coordinates, functions and mappers in the attribute of the polygon create the polygons instead of giving hard values straght in the attribute line.
