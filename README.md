Assignment 1 name : Boston Celtics performance of last 10 games

As a super fan of the Boston Celtics, I believe that most fans like me want to know the team's recent performance. So I designed and produced this page to show the status of the last ten teams and the performance of the home and away games in some aspects.

In this website, it's mainly divided into three parts.
1)First part: Explain that the team introduced by the website is a Celtics. As everyone knows, green is the main color of the Celtics, so about the team name I used green.
2)Second part: I created a line chart and used this line chart to represent the scores of each of the last ten Celtics, so that the viewer has a certain understanding of the team's recent offensive status. Each game has a score for each point. The red point indicates the home game and the black point indicates the away game. This point becomes larger when the mouse is over the point.（I originally wanted to make a specific score on the game when I clicked on the mouse, but I tried it for a long time and filed.）
3)Third part: In this section, I made two polygons, the red one indicates the home field, the black one represents the away game, and then I collected the data of the home and away games in the last ten games to show the team's situation.
